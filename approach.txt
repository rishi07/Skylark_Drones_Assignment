1. 	Extracted the Photo_Location.kmz file.

2. 	Parsed and read the data from the .kml file obtained after extraction using BeautifulSoup lxml parser.

3. 	While reading I stored the name, the latitude and the longitude of the image in seperate lists. Elavation is not taken into
	account as the image location captured by the drone is at the ground. The elavation is due to the position of the drone which 
	is redundant. We are considering 2-D distance (ground to ground).

4.	Now I read the DJI_0301.SRT file and for each time stamp I traversed the whole lists of coordinates saved in step 3, and
	calculated the distance for each of the pair and if it is less than 35 metres I noted it's details in my output.csv file.

5.	Now, for the assets.csv file I did the same way. First I read the data from assets.csv file and then calculated the distance 
	for each of them and if it is less than 50 then I wrote it in the output_assets.csv file.
